# Value Resources (Turkish - `tr`)

This directory contains the Turkish language resource files for the application. The Android system automatically selects these resources when the user's device language is set to Turkish (`tr`).

These files provide translations for the default resources found in the `res/values/` directory, ensuring that Turkish-speaking users have a fully localized experience.

## Files

### `strings.xml`

This file contains the Turkish translations for all the user-facing text defined in the default `strings.xml`. This includes button labels, setting titles and summaries, dialog messages, and all other text in the UI.

### `arrays.xml`

This file provides the Turkish translations for the user-visible entries in the `ListPreference` settings (e.g., for Theme and Language selection). It overrides the default English arrays with their Turkish equivalents.
